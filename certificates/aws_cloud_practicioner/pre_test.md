## 1. Cloud Concepts

### 1.1 Define the benefits of the AWS Cloud

- **Pay-as-you-go Pricing**: A pricing model where you replace fixed expenses (capital expenses) with variable expenses. You only pay for what you consume, with no long-term contracts or upfront commitments.
  
- **Volume Discounts**: A tiered pricing model where the "price per unit" gets lower as the usage increases (e.g., the more storage you use in S3, the less you pay per GB).

- **Agility**: The ability to deploy resources, such as computing, storage, or databases, in a matter of minutes.

- **Elasticity**: The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them.

- **High Availability**: Refers to applications that have no single point of failure. Highly available applications will continue to run and be available even if there is a failure in the design. 

- **Reliability**: The ability of an application to perform its intended function correctly and consistently. This characteristic includes the ability to recover from failure and scale horizontally.

- **Performance**: The ability to use resources efficiently and optimize the performance even as demand changes.
