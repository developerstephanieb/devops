##

- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Checks security groups for rules that allow unrestricted access to a resource.

- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Manages permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.

## 

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Service used to deploy and scale web applications and services developed with common programming languages on automatically deployed infrastructure with capacity management, load balancing, auto scaling, and monitoring. Facilitates application provisioning and support.

- **Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**: An in-memory cache used to reduce response times from a DynamoDB table from milliseconds to microseconds.

- **Amazon Route 53**: Highly available and scalable DNS web service. The three main functions of Route 53 are registering domain names, routing internet traffic to the resources for the domain, and checking the health of those resources.

- **Amazon CloudFront**: A web service that speeds up the distribution of static and dynamic content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to the users. Content is cached in edge locations.

- **Availability Zone (AZ)**: One or more discrete data centers within an AWS Region. Each AZ has independent power, networking, and is isolated from failures in other AZs.

- **Multi-AZ Deployment** (High availability and Resilience): Strategy that involves deploying an application across multiple AZs within the same Region. If one AZ fails, the application continues to run from the other(s), preventing a single point of failure.

- **Cross-Region Deployment** (Low Latency): Strategy used to serve a global audience by placing resources in Regions geographically closer to the end-users.

## 

- **AWS Global Accelerator**: A networking service that improves the availability and performance of applications for global users by providing static IP addresses (a fixed, global entry point) and using the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal (nearest and healthiest) endpoint.

- **Amazon DynamoDB**: A fully managed serverless NoSQL database service. 

- **Amazon Aurora**: A relational database service that is fully compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL.

- **Amazon Elastic Block Store**: A block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2. It's ideal for transaction-intensive workloads, such as running a database on an EC2 instance.
